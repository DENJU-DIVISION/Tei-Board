# Tei board Â∏ù
The Tei Board is a PCB designed mainly for minisumo robots, but it can be used for other projects or categories.\
It's a simple begginer-level PCB, uses mostly SMD components that are easy to find and solder, so it should be really simple to build.\
The processor is a Arduino Nano, and the motor driver is the TB6612FNG both very cheap and easy to find components.\
It's designed to support up to 15V but we recomend using a maximum of 3S batteries.\
This board is perfect for those just starting in robotics, easy to program and has a lot of capabilities. We recommend the use of this board for amateur categories of minisumo or line followers.\
