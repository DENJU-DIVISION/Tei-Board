# QTmicro
One of the smallest line sensors suitable for minisumo and micro sumo projects

## List of materials
- PCB
- QRE1113

QTR solo is the gerber file for **ONLY ONE SENSOR** the sensor it's small so I reccomend making a panelized version, the way you panel the sensors depends on the manufacturer capabitities
